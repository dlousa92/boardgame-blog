      <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>I started gaming when I was about 7 years old. My first distinct boardgaming memories were my dad playing Sorry and Parchesi
         with my brother and I. Soon thereafter I discovered my unique talent, or unfortunate talent I should say. I stink at rolling dice, bad.
         So on came the days of Monopoly and Mouse Trap and Risk and on came more losing! I always had a great time though, and I loved sitting down
         and playing a game with my loved ones nonetheless. During the early teen part of my life I found myself drifting towards a lot of Collectible Card Games,
         a little bit of Magic: The Gathering, some Pok√©mon, Pirates of the Spanish Main, Heroclix. Then one day I stumbled into Dominion
         at my local gaming store. A card game where I build my own deck as I play? What sort of nonsensical approach is this? A half hour
         later and I was absolutely hooked. I couldn't stop playing. Shortly after that I discovered Co-op games through Pandemic,
         and I couldnt get enough of those, either. My collection went from two games, to four, to eight and before I knew it I was sitting at twenty games
         and I knew this was no longer a small past-time but my favorite hobby. I've been gaming ever since and I'm just getting started!
         My tastes range from Ameritrash to heavy, meaty Euro-games and from light and short party games to sprawling campaign adventures. I hope we can share in our love
         for gaming through this blog.

      <h2>Food</h2>
      <p>My father is Spaniard and my mother is Dominican, needless to say growing up was a wide culinary experience for me. I assume this is where my love
         for the food arts began, eating simple things like rice and beans and steak, to more exotic dining experiences like Octopus and Pigs Feet Stew.
         I found myself wanting to experience foods of all cultures, to go out and experiment and taste all things. So I did! I found myself loving
         Korean BBQ and Mediterranean, Southern Comfort food and German Bratwurst. My tastes widend as did my appetite. I started sharing what I ate and I found joy
         in taking people to the small mom and pop shops of excellent food I had found. So I hope through this blog I can share some of my foodie adventures with you, 
         and maybe find a shared love for a dish.</p>
