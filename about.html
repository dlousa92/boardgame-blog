      <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>I started gaming when I was about 7 years old. My first distinct boardgaming memories were my dad playing Sorry and Parchesi
         with me and my brother. Soon thereafter I discovered my unique talent, or unfortunate talent, better said. I stink at rolling dice, bad.
         So on came the days of Monopoly and Mouse Trap and Risk and on came more losing! I always had a great time though, and I loved sitting down
         and playing a game with my loved ones nonetheless. During the early teen part of my life I found myself drifting to a lot of Collectible Card Games,
         a little bit of Magic: The Gathering, some Pok√©mon, Pirates of the Spanish Main, Heroclix. Then one day I stumbled into Dominion
         at my local gaming store. A card game where I build my own deck as I play? What sort of nonsensical approach is this? A half hour
         later and I was absolutely hooked. I couldn't stop playing. Shortly after that I discovered Co-op games through Pandemic,
         and I couldnt get enough of those, either. My collection went from two games, to four, to eight, before I knew it I was sitting at twenty games
         and I knew this was no longer a small past-time but my favorite hobby. I've been gaming ever since and I'm just getting started!
         My tastes range from Ameritrash to heavy, meaty Euro-games, light and short party games to sprawling campaigns. I hope we can share in our love
         for gaming through this blog.
